## QP/C++ ESP32

C++ Port for the ESP32 microcontroller from [espressif](https://www.espressif.com/). The port is compatible with the native sdk from espressif, [esp-idf](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf), and the [arduino sdk](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32).

## CppUTest for QP/C++ (cpputest-for-qpcpp)

[![cpputest-for-qpcpp](img/cpputest-qpcpp-img.jpg)](https://github.com/covemountainsoftware/cpputest-for-qpcpp)

A port of `qpcpp` with additional supporting code to enable and simplify host based unit testing 
of `QActive` objects using CppUTest. Includes examples demonstrating topics such as:  
* Capturing and testing of published events.
* Testing subscribed event behavior.
* Testing direct post behavior.
* Testing interactions with other active objects.
* Testing interactions with a mocked driver.
* An example continuous integration (CI) setup using GitHub Actions.
* And more!

## CppUTest for QP/C (cpputest-for-qpc)

[![cpputest-for-qpc](img/cpputest-qpc-img.jpg)](https://github.com/covemountainsoftware/cpputest-for-qpc)

This port is conceptually the same as `cpputest-for-qpcpp` (noted above) but instead uses QP's C language 
based framework (`qpc`) with CppUTest. See the details on `cpputest-for-qpcpp` above for benefits, which also apply to 
this version.
